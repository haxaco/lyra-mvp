# Figma Make Components - Status & Additions

## ✅ Components From Figma Make

These were already exported from Figma Make and copied to `@lyra/ui`:

1. **UIButton** - Button with variants (default, destructive, outline, etc.)
2. **UICard** - Card container with Header, Content, Footer, Title, Description
3. **UIInput** - Text input with validation states
4. **UIBadge** - Badge/tag component with variants
5. **UISkeleton** - Loading skeleton placeholder
6. **UIAvatar** - Avatar with image and fallback

## ⚠️ Missing From Figma Make (Added as Stubs)

These components were referenced in Figma pages but not exported by Figma Make. We created minimal stub implementations:

### 1. **DropdownMenu** (stub)
**Why needed**: AppShell uses it for user menu  
**Implementation**: Basic dropdown with items, labels, separators  
**File**: `packages/ui/src/primitives/UIDropdownMenu.tsx`  
**Exports**: 
- DropdownMenu
- DropdownMenuTrigger
- DropdownMenuContent
- DropdownMenuItem
- DropdownMenuLabel
- DropdownMenuSeparator

**Recommendation**: Replace with full Radix UI implementation when needed

### 2. **Select** (stub)
**Why needed**: LibraryPage and AnalyticsPage use selects for filtering  
**Implementation**: Basic select with trigger and items  
**File**: `packages/ui/src/primitives/UISelect.tsx`  
**Exports**:
- Select
- SelectTrigger
- SelectValue
- SelectContent
- SelectItem

**Recommendation**: Replace with full Radix UI implementation when needed

### 3. **Label** (stub)
**Why needed**: PlaylistBuilderPage and OnboardingFlow use form labels  
**Implementation**: Styled `<label>` element  
**File**: `packages/ui/src/primitives/UILabel.tsx`  
**Exports**: Label

### 4. **Slider** (stub)
**Why needed**: PlaylistBuilderPage uses sliders for music parameters  
**Implementation**: HTML5 range input with custom styling  
**File**: `packages/ui/src/primitives/UISlider.tsx`  
**Exports**: Slider

**Features**:
- value/onValueChange API (array-based like Radix)
- min/max/step props
- Custom thumb styling

### 5. **Tabs** (stub)
**Why needed**: PlaylistsIndexPage uses tabs for view switching  
**Implementation**: Context-based tabs with controlled state  
**File**: `packages/ui/src/primitives/UITabs.tsx`  
**Exports**:
- Tabs
- TabsList
- TabsTrigger
- TabsContent

**Features**:
- Context-based state management
- Controlled/uncontrolled modes
- Active state styling

## 🔧 Import Normalizations Applied

### Before (from Figma Make):
```tsx
import { Menu } from "lucide-react@0.487.0";
import { cn } from "../../components/ui/utils";
import { Button } from "../../components/ui/button";
```

### After (normalized):
```tsx
import { Menu } from "lucide-react";
import { cn, Button } from "@lyra/ui";
```

## 🎯 Vercel Build Status

### Issues Fixed:
1. ✅ Versioned imports removed (`lucide-react@0.487.0` → `lucide-react`)
2. ✅ Invalid paths fixed (`../../components/ui/*` → `@lyra/ui`)
3. ✅ Missing DropdownMenu added (stub)
4. ✅ Missing Select added (stub)
5. ✅ Missing Label added (stub)
6. ✅ Missing Slider added (stub)
7. ✅ Missing Tabs added (stub)
8. ✅ TypeScript errors resolved
9. ✅ `lucide-react` installed in web app

### Build Result:
```
✅ @lyra/ui builds successfully (43.48 KB ESM)
✅ @lyra/sdk builds successfully (5.50 KB ESM)
✅ All Figma pages import correctly
```

## 🚀 Production Recommendations

For a fully-featured UI, consider replacing stubs with proper Radix UI implementations:

```bash
pnpm add -w @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu \
            @radix-ui/react-select \
            @radix-ui/react-label \
            @radix-ui/react-slider \
            @radix-ui/react-tabs
```

Then update the stub files to use Radix primitives with proper accessibility and features.

## 📊 Summary

- **From Figma**: 6 primitives + 3 layout + 1 shell + 7 pages = **17 components**
- **Added as stubs**: 5 components (DropdownMenu, Select, Label, Slider, Tabs)
- **Total in @lyra/ui**: **22 components**

All Figma pages can now render with live data! 🎉
